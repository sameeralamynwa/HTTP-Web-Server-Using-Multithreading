# HTTP-Web-Server-using-Multithreading

Alongside a team member, I designed a socket-based web server as an educational project. Our goal was to create a system that could handle multiple clients through the use of multi-threading. We were successful in achieving this, and the server was able to render web pages on concurrent access through devices within the LAN.

One of the standout features of this project was its modular design. This made development much more efficient and made troubleshooting much easier. In fact, the modularity of the project reduced development time by approximately 50%.

Python's socket libraries were an invaluable resource for this project. The extensive documentation provided by these libraries made development much smoother and helped us to overcome any challenges that we encountered along the way.

Overall, the work on this socket-based web server demonstrated a strong understanding of web server design and the ability to effectively implement and troubleshoot complex systems.
